# PERN Template

PERN stack template with latest package versions

This repository contains a template for setting up a full-stack application using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). The template is configured with the latest versions of all required packages, ensuring compatibility and access to the most up-to-date features and security patches.

It provides a ready-to-use foundation for building robust web applications, including backend API setup with Express, database integration using PostgreSQL, and a frontend built with React. Whether you're starting a new project or experimenting with the stack, this template offers a clean, modern setup with minimal configuration.

Features:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - A powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL to store structured data. It supports advanced features like JSON data types, ACID compliance, and complex queries, making it ideal for handling both relational and semi-structured data in large-scale applications.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - A lightweight and fast web framework for Node.js, used to build the backend and handle HTTP requests and API routes efficiently.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications where dynamic, real-time updates are key.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v17.9.0) - A JavaScript runtime that allows us to use JavaScript on the server-side, handling backend logic, APIs, and database operations.
